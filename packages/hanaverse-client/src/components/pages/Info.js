      <h2>Hananoids</h2>
      <p>
        The Hananoids are known for their rain droplet shape, round eyes, and goofy, toothless
        smile. Hananoids love water and nature that water grows around them, and also art, music and
        poetry, and all the good things of the world.
      </p>
      <h2>Hana Village</h2>
      <p>
        This is the town where your Hananoids live. Ideally, the Hana Village is surrounded with
        fertile grass. Plentiful rain throughout the whole year in the village makes it a place full
        of lakes and rivers. Hananoids are good at swimming and cultivating the land.
      </p>
      <h2>Water consumption</h2>
      <p>
        Since water is essential for the Hananoids and their land to prosper, your responsibility is
        to conserve water and make sure the Hananoids have enough water for them to grow and stay
        healthy.
